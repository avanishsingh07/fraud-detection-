fraud detection (INSAID data)

I investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features and understanding the relationship between different features. I then investigated two predictive models. The data was split in 3 parts, a train set, a validation set and a test set. For the first three models, we only used the train and test set.I investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features and understanding the relationship between different features.
